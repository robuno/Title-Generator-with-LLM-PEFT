# Title Generator with LLM & PEFT (LoRA)

âœ¨ [UPDATE]: LLama2 fine-tuned with QLoRA will be added soon!

This project aims to **generate a title from the given abstract** for academic articles. Models were fine tuned with **PEFT** using the [ArXiv dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv). Two different models were tuned with [**LoRA** (Hu et al., 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685). Only articles in the computer science category were selected in the **ArXiv dataset**. This number has also been reduced due to memory and time limits. The fine-tuned models are available via HuggingFace spaces:

- [HuggingFace Spaces BART](https://huggingface.co/robuno/title-generation-bart-6000-v2-1)
- [HuggingFace Spaces T5](https://huggingface.co/robuno/title-generation-t5base-6000-v2-1)


The project includes:
- Low Rank Adaptation Method (LoRA)
- Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)
- HuggingFace model trainings (T5-base, BART-base)
- Evaluation metric of `Rouge Score`
- One-shot, zero-shot evaluation and addition of instruction prompt
- Model merging and uploading to HuggingFace
- Tracking logs, memory usage, elapsed time for preprocessing, training, evaluation processes, visualization of training/testing loss
- EDA and script for filtering the ArXiv dataset with only Computer Science (CS) articles. 
- Filtering and converting .json dataset to .csv format

External libraries and packages:
- Torch
- HuggingFace
- Transformers
- BitsAndBytes
- PEFT
- Accelerate
- Evaluate (Rouge score)
- LoraLib
- Trl
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, tqdm, time

Training Parameters and Limitations
- 6000 training samples, 1000 validation samples, 250 test samples are filtered from the dataset.
- *(Number of CS related papers is 299131. However, one of the aims of this project is check the efficiency of small LLMs with PEFT/LORA. Therefore, the less training data samples and less training epochs are considered.)*
- Models are trained for 6 epochs.
- Lora attention `R=8`, `alpha=64`, `dropout=0.01`, `learning rate=2e-4`, `paged_adamW_32bit optimizer`
